 <p>Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the english language today, is the word fuck. Out of all the english words that begin with the letter 'f' ...fuck is the only word refered to as 'the f word... It's the one magical word. Just by its sound can describe pain, pleasure, hate and love. Fuck, as most words in the english language is derived from german ...the word fuieken, which means to strike.</p> 
<p>In english, fuck falls into many grammatical categories: </p>
 <p>As a transitive verb for intance ...John fucked Shirley. </p>
<p>As an intransitive verb...Shirley fucks.</p> 
 <p>Its meaning is not always sexual, it can be used as...</p> 
 <p>An adjective such as ...John's doing all the fucking work.</p> 
<p>As part of an adverb ...Shirley talks too fucking much.</p> 
<p>As an adverb enhancing an adjective ...Shirley is fucking beautiful.</p> 
<p>As a noun ...I don't give a fuck.</p> 
<p>As part of a word ...absofuckinglutely -or- infuckingcredible.</p> 
<p>And as almost every word in a sentence ...Fuck the fucking fuckers.</p> 
 <p>As you must realize, there aren't too many words with the versatility of fuck...such as these examples describing situations such as: </p>
 <p>Fraud ...I got fucked at the used car lot. </p>
<p>Dismay ...ahhh fuck it. </p>
<p>Trouble ...I guess I'm really fucked now. </p>
<p>Agression ...Don't fuck with me buddy. </p>
<p>Difficulty ...I don't understand this fucking question. </p>
<p>Inquiry ...Who the fuck was that? </p>
<p>Dissatisfaction ...I don't like what the fuck is going on here. </p>
<p>Incompetance ...He's a fuck-off. </p>
<p>Dismissal ...Why don't you go outside and play hide and go fuck yourself... </p>
 <p>I'm sure you can think of many more examples. </p>
<p>With all these multi-purpose applications, how can anyone be offended when you use the word. We say use this unique, flexible word more often in your daily speech. </p>
<p>It will identify the quality of your character immediately. </p>
<p>Say it loudly and proudly... </p>

 <p>The Wet Shit </p>
<p>You wipe your ass fifty times and it still feels unwiped. So you end up putting toilet paper between your ass and your underwear so you don't ruin them with those dreadful skid marks. </p>
 <p>The Second Wave Shit </p>
<p>This shit happens when you've finished, your pants are up to your knees, and you suddenly realize you have to shit some more. </p>
 <p>The Brain Hemorrahage Through Your Nose Shit </p>

<p>The kind where you want to shit, but even after straining your guts out, all you can do is sit on the toilet, cramped and farting. </p>

<p>Also known as the "Power Dump". That's the kind that comes out of your ass so fast that your butt cheeks get splashed with the toilet water. </p>
 <p>The Liquid Shit </p>
<p>That's the kind where yellowish-brown liquid shoots out of your butt, splashes all over the side of the toilet bowl and, at the same time, chronically burns your tender poop-chute. </p>
 <p>The Mexican Food Shit </p>
<p>A class all on its own.</p> 
 <p>The Crowd Pleaser </p>
<p>This shit is so intriguing in size and/or appearance that you have to show it to someone before flushing. </p>
 <p>The Mood Enhancer </p>
<p>This shit occurs after a lengthy period of constipation, thereby allowing you to be your old self again. </p>
 <p>The Ritual </p>

<p>This appears in the toilet mysteriously and no one will admit to putting it there. </p>

<p>A long skinny shit which has managed to coil itself into a frightening position - usually harmless. </p>
 <p>The Olympic Shit </p>
<p>This shit occurs exactly one hour prior to the start of any competitive event in which you are entered and bears a close resemblance to the Drinker's Shit. </p>

 <p>The Spinal Tap Shit </p>
<p>The kind of shit that hurts so much coming out, you'd swear it's got to be coming out sideways. </p>
 <p>The "I Think I'm Giving Birth Through My Asshole" Shit </p>
<p>Similar to the Lincoln Log and The Spinal Tap Shits. The shape and size of the turd resembles a tall boy beer can. Vacuous air space remains in the rectum for some time afterwards. </p>
 <p>The Porridge Shit </p>
<p>The type that comes out like toothpaste, and just keeps on coming. You have two choices: a) flush and keep going, or b) risk it piling up to your butt while you sit there helpless. </p>
 <p>The "I'm Going To Chew My Food Better" Shit </p>
<p>When the bag of Doritos you ate last night lacerates the insides of your rectum on the way out in the morning. </p>
 <p>The "I Think I'm Turning Into A Bunny" Shit </p>
<p>When you drop lots of cute, little round ones that look like marbles and make tiny splashing sounds when they hit the water. </p>
 <p>The "What The Hell Died In Here?" Shit </p>
<p>Also sometimes referred to as "The Toxic Dump". Of course you don't warn anyone of the poisonous bathroom odour. Instead, you stand innocently near the door and enjoy the show as they run out gagging and gasping for air. </p>
 <p>The "I Just Know There's A Turd Still Dangling There" Shit </p>
<p>Where you just sit there patiently and wait for the last cling-on to drop off because if you wipe now, it's going to smear all over the place. </p>

<p>The term "douchebag" generally refers to a male with a certain combination of obnoxious characteristics related to attitude, social ineptitude, public behavior,
 or outward presentation.Though the common douchebag thinks he is accepted by the people around him, most of his peers dislike him. He has an inflated sense of 
self-worth, compounded by a lack of social grace and self-awareness. He behaves 
inappropriately in public, yet is completely ignorant to how pathetic he appears
 to others.He often talks about how cool, successful, and popular he is, yet never catches on to the fact that he comes across as a total loser. Nevertheless, he firmly believes that he is the smartest, most desirable, and most charming per
son in the room... and will try to bad-rep anyone who would threaten to expose this facade.He fancies himself a ladies’ man, yet tends to be a joke to all but the most naive of women. He tries to portray himself as part of the in-crowd (a fashionista, an upwardly mobile professional, the life of the party, etc.) but on
ly succeeds in his own mind.To everyone else, he is an annoying and arrogant phony who comes across as a wannabe overcompensating for his insecurities. He tries
 to appear like the center of whatever group will tolerate him, but in reality, 
he is just a tag-along who mooches drinks, women, contacts, social standing, and
 other benefits from the group... while contributing nothing.A-list ego; D-list 
status.</p>
<br>
<p>douchebag == </p>
<p>the scientific name for schmucks who roll up in public wearing wife-beaters or oversized jeans.  Can also be found wearing sunglasses in nightclubs and/or sun-visors on backwards and upside down.

<p>A person with a shitty personality that needs to "take themself the fuck down" or "go home and get their fucking shine box."

<p>Bastardization of clitoris.</p>
 <p>Located at the point where the labia (lips of the vagina) coverge at the top of the vagina.  It usually is hidden beneath what looks to be a large fleshy nub called a hood.  When stimulated or by pushing the pelvic tissue upward, it can be seen. </p>
 <p>Extremely sensitive organ that produces immense amounts of sexual pleasure for most women.  When properly stimulated, can induce multiple orgasms.</p>
 <p>Marks women as the only animal on this planet with an organ designated solely for sexual pleasure.</p>
 <p>Usually a must for most women during sexual intercourse.  Most face to face positions allow for it to be "crushed" by flesh and pushed upward by thrusts via the male hips.  Not suprisingly, most women find it difficult to orgasm in positions that do not allow for the stimulation of the clitoris without some hand to hand help.</p>
 <p>A reasonable substitute for foreplay. </p>
 <p>Formed from the same tissue as the head of the male penis.</p>

<h1>jerk</h1>
<br>
<p>jerk == </p>
<p>The kind of guy most girls ACTUALLY want when they say they want a Nice Guy.</p>
 <p>Jerks are selfish, manipulative bastards who see women as little more then sexual conquests to brag about to their buddies or mere objects that are there for their personal pleasure. As to ensure the post-sex breakup will be in their favor, Jerks often play the "sensative guy" early on so the girl will make most of the moves on HIM, and after he's done with her and dumps her for some other girl just like her, he can make it look like she's at fault for coming on too strong, and consequently she'll take him back if he chooses to return for seconds.</p>
 <p>Typically are/were Frat Boys, Jocks, and Preps in school.</p>

<br>
<p>dick == </p>
<p>Man's most magnificently majestic manifestation of his raw power and potency. In appearance, when hard, it resembles a rocket on the launching pad, and it has the same turbulent thrusting force and energy. Just as a rocket can send a satellite into orbit, it can send a woman into orgasm, which is no less awesome a feat.
In sex, it performs at least four distinct functions: first, by achieving a hard-on, it signals to the woman that its owner is both capable of having sex with her and eager to do so, which, if she finds him attractive, tends to kindle her interest. Second, by discreetly (or sometimes not so discreetly) pressing it against her increasingly warm pussy while they make out, he turns her on and gets her hot. Then, when she really does want him, it becomes a way of her signalling her own desire, as she fondles it and kisses it and puts it into her mouth. And finally, when he fucks her, its mad and relentless thrusting drives her wild until she begins to scream with absolutely uncontrollable passion and happiness. If 
he is lucky enough, he has enough dick control that he doesn't come until after 
this has happened, which is nice for him as well as her, because the longer the 
tension builds up, the more enormous the explosion will be when he finally reaches ejaculation. At that point, as the speed of his thrusting becomes as fast as 
a runner nearing the finish line in a race and as his cock forces all of its gigantic length and girth deep into her pussywith each thrust, he reaches the point
 where, for a couple of seconds, it seems like the world stops. Then, he feels something like a bomb explode at the base of his dick, and with a sudden and rapid force like water shooting out of a high-pressure hose, he shoots quarts of come into her pussy.</p>
In keeping with the Danish proverb that "a child of love has many names," this most-beloved part of the male anatomy has a number of colloquial slang nicknames, of which penis is the one most often seen in print, though rarely heard spoken except in doctor's offices or classrooms. A few of the more colorful are given below. In addition to these nicknames, many a guy's dick has a proper name, bestowed on it either by his wife or girlfriend or by himself, and which hopefully has a masculine ring worthy of the dignity of the entity to which it is applied.</p>

<br>
<p>queer == </p>
<p>Originally meant to describe something as unusual or strange.  Became a deroggatory word to describe homosexuals.  More recently, it has been reclaimed by non-heterosexuals as a word used to describe themselves.  Queer can now be used to describe homosexuals, bisexuals, and transgendered people.  In scholarly studies the word queer is also used to describe those who practice unconventional sex (e.g. bondage, etc.), therefore even heterosexuals can sometimes be defined as queer.</p>
<br>
<p>queer == </p>
<p>Re-claimed umbrella term used to describe the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender/Transsexual and general non-heterosexual communities. Queer is the opposite of Straight.</p>

It is still often used (just as ‘gay’ is) as an insult to queer people, but is taken with a pinch of salt these days.</p>
<br>
<p>queer == </p>
<p>Originaly meant strange or odd.  Now stands for anyone who is sexualy different but may or may not mean gay.

<p>5. an identity used to be vague or non-specific about a person's sexual orientation, identifying with the LGBT community as a whole. Also a description of people's non-heterosexual sexual orientations in a non-specific and unbiased manner</p>
<p>6. an identity used because the terms gay, lesbian, or bisexual are not sufficient for their inner feelings</p>
<p>7. an identity used because some individuals whose gender or sex is non-conforming may not have an easy way to culturally identify their sexual orientation.</p>
<p>8. an academic word used in the context of “queer theory” and “queer studies.” The term queer replaces the term homosexual or LGBT.</p>

<br>
<p>motherfucker == </p>
<p>A common slang derived most popularly from a form of "yo momma jokes" but actually dating waaaay the hell back to the 1300's when it was considered the highest sin to sleep with ones own mother. (Even above murder.)</p>
 <p>It can mean precisely as it sounds, one who has sex mothers, but it was originally meant as "one who has sex with their own mother".</p>
 <p>It is most of the time used without meaning, just to be said in a sentence, it can mean absolutely nothing and absolutely everything its meant to at the same time. </p>
 <p>Also is used constantly to denote someone is a moron, a trife, a back stabber, and any number of other completely unrelated meanings. </p>
<br>
<p>motherfucker == </p>
<p>Is a noun that can represent any person place or thing.</p>
<br>
<p>motherfucker == </p>
<p>word that really has no meaning, because it can be used as a compliment just as easily as i can be used as as an insult.  probably the most widely used curse in the english language</p>
<br>
<p>motherfucker == </p>
<p>is a (1)PERSON, (2)PLACE, (3)THING, or (4)EVENT.</p>
<br>
<p>motherfucker ==</p> 
<p>Motherfucker (also contracted forms mother and mofo and, phonetically, in African-American vernacular speech, muthafucka) is a common insult and profanity in the English language and is widely considered obscene and inappropriate. By virtue of its history of usage, motherfucker generally is regarded as African-American in origin. Literally, it accuses one of violating, perhaps, the oldest taboo known to humankind, incest. However, as with most epithets, its use is pejorative, rather than literal. Historically, it was a vicious taunt, a damning insult -- and a veiled allusion to the destruction of black male familial hegemony under chattel slavery. The power of the word was that it attacked one's sense of manhood. Regardless of its historical or cultural context, however, many consider motherfucker the mother of all curse words. The cause of countless barroom brawls and streetfights, it is purported to have sparked at least one prison riot.</p>
 <p>Motherfucker has taken on additional meanings through continued use, its evolution being shaped primarily by, again, the African-American community. It has come to mean a formidable or inexorable force, as in the threat: "Payback is a bitch, but revenge is a muthafucka." It is also an expression of disgust or contempt: "Now, ain't that a muthafucka!" Motherfucker also has come to be used in some circles as a general pronoun.</p>
 <p>The initials M.F. became a common, more polite substitute for motherfucker, as did the term Maryland farmer in the 1960s and 1970s. The result is an oft-recounted, if somewhat apocryphal, tale of the clueless Maryland Farmers Association writing a letter of protest to a prominent African-American in the news. It seems he called a Capitol Hill politician a "jive Maryland farmer," and the association's members were mightily offended.</p>
 <p>The growing use of motherfucker in American popular culture may mean the term through time has become less offensive to some, but some see its increasing ubiquity as a sign of the general coarsening of American society.</p>
<br>
<p>motherfucker == </p>
<p>An insult or an explitive, addressing somebody who sleeps (ie. has sex with) one's mother. Often used to describe someone that you hate, but it's also used among close friends as a term of affection.</p>

<p>gook == </p>
<p>A term used to describe Koreans. Gook is still a controversial slur. Some Koreans may take it as a joke but some may take as a serious racial slur.</p>
<p>The history behind it is that during the Korean war, an American approached a Korean.</p>
<p>The Korean did not understand the American, instead he pointed at him and called out "Mi Gook" which means "America" in Korean. The American then mistakened the Korean and thought the Korean was refering to himself as a "gook." After the Korean War, American started to refer to Koreans as Gooks for short term thinking it was a short name for Korean. </p>

<div class=gringo>
<h1>gringo</h1>
<br>
<p>gringo == </p>
<p>If you know any mexican people then you'll know this is a non-derogatory term used to refer to US citizens. Mostly because the term "American" does not make sense to the rest of the Americans (all those people who live in the continent named "America", wich is every body from Alaska to argentina), and the word "Estadounidense" (UnitedStatean)is too long.</p>
<p> Folklore says it was generated when the US invaded mexico, wearing green uniforms, and the people shouted at them "Green Go Home".</p>
 <p>With time it lost all derogatory status and was turned into the most common word  to refer to any US citizen.</p>
<br>
<p>gringo == </p>
<p>a gringo is just a north american or anglo-saxon. it is usually a white person but doesnt have to be. it isnt a hateful term but it can be used hatefully. it also represents behaviour and attitudes latinos consider to be "american".</p>
<br>
<p>gringo == </p>
<p>Term used by Latin Americans to talk about an American, it doesnt matter the color of his skin</p>
<br>
<p>gringo == </p>
<p>The word originated in Mexico, when the United States of America invaded Mexico in order to appropiate half of its territory, back on mid 19th century. Of course this action against "peace and freedom" is not in elementary school textbooks in USA, but it is in any other serious document about USA history.</p>
 <p>American soldiers entered the country through the Gulf of Mexico, taking down the main port of Veracruz and then heading towards Mexico City. The troops were wearing GREEN COATS.</p>
 <p>Mexican people along the way from Veracruz to Mexico suffered the advance of the enemy and many battles were fought. However, the American army finally reached Mexico City and took the city down in an epic battle still remembered by all the Mexicans: The battle of Chapultepec Castle. This palace, in the top of a hill, is the highest point over Mexico City: there was the Mexican flag, so it was a symbolic target.</p>
 <p>The headquarters of the Military College were in Chapultepec castle too, and when the "green coats" were climbing the hill, a few young cadets refused to leave and decided to defend the castle to death. Then, when the battle was helplessly lost, one of the cadets took the Mexican flag, wrapped himself on it and jumped off the cliff were the castle is set, dying in the rocks below, thus avoiding the American army to take the flag. When the American commander saw the corpses of the cadets, he said in amazement "They are only children!". So they became in death Los Niños Héroes, the symbol in Mexico of the resistance against invaders: the American army... the green coats.</p>
 <p>The war was over and USA claimed half of Mexico's territory... then the green coats went home, having gained possesion of Texas and other territories -and their resources- (the same old motif than nowadys, but the speech has changed).</p>
 <p>Ever since, the relationtship USA-Mexico has developed into a very complex love-hate relationtship and the destiny of both nations is linked together, but back then, a new term was born in popular language: gringo (green coat)</p>
 <p>Now, let's make clear that the term is used nowadays the same as affectionate as pejorative and as none of the above too. As complex as it seems, Mexican people can use the word with different intentions but in any case with just one meaning: it refers in a common way to USA citizens, who are distinctive not because of the colour of their skin, but because of their culture and behavior (anyone outside USA knows exactly what behavior is it!)</p>
 <p>Other derivatives of the word include:</p>
 <p>gringa: female for gringo, as substantive.</p>
<p> gringo/gringa: as adjectives.</p>
 <p>agringado: something/someone that resembles USA culture or the American way of life.</p>
 <p>Gringolandia: U.S.A.</p>
 <p>As a final note i must say that the word spread to other countries over Latin America (even to Spain) where it is used to refer to foreigners and/or white people: but that's just the way some people outside Mexico understand the word!</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, in Mexico, a "gringo" is just an American citizen. And it implies nothing else.</p>
<br>
<p>gringo == </p>
<p>gringo == </p>
<p>1.-In Monterrey, Mexico, we use the word "gringo" for people who were born in the US. 
It has nothing to do with race. It's not derogative.It's a nationality.
If someone says "pinche gringo" the derogative word is "pinche", not "gringo". 
We call them gringos because it'd be stupid to call them "americans", since America is a continent, not a country.</p>
 <p>2.- Something from the US </p>
<br>
<p>gringo == </p>
<p>In Mexico proper, "Gringo" can have a derogatory, or casual/ non pejorative meaning depending on the context of which it is delivered. "Gabacho" has more insulting connotations. A commonly held myth within the environs of Mexico itself is that the origin of "Gringo" was an allusion as to the U.S. Army under the commands of generals Taylor/Scott fielding green coloured uniforms, hence the "Green-Go!!!" silliness. (This is utter rubbish, as any serious student of the Mexican-American War knows that it was the colour blue, and remained so till khaki, and later, onward thence to green, replaced it many decades later. A popular song commonly sung by the intrepid American troops, whilst they marched along was, "Green Grow the Rushes," these words being repeated (refrained) throughout the song, "Green grow,..etc," being taken by (the then) contemporary Mexican ear as "gringo." (The most "likely" origin...) In other regions, apart from Mexico itself, it basically refers to any "european looking" individual.</p>
<br>
<p>gringo == </p>
<p>Contrary to some things that have been posted here, the US did not wear green coats, or green uniforms, during the Mexican American War, so that explanation for the origin of this word is bogus.But the term is indeed related to American soldiers who invaded Mexico during the Mexican-American war. It actually came from the lines of what was then a song that was very popular with American infantrymen.See the example.</p>

<div class=scum>
<h1>scum</h1>
<br>
<p>scum == </p>
<p>(adj.) Possibly the worst word you can have your name associated with.</p>
 <p>It is hard to define the word, but it is basically used to describe someone so disgraceful that they are seen as the lowest form of life.  "Worthlessness", "waste of skin", "dirt".  "Nothing".  Far worse than most other insults, where the victim is often just referred to as genetalia.</p>
 <p>The fact that "scum" is a non-swear, and seen as perfectly acceptable English, makes it even more demeaning and offensive.  If you are condemned as a "cunt" or a "fucktard", then you are simply being attacked with cliché profanity, used spontaneously and with no particular venom or thought.  "Scum", however, is usually only used in exclusive conditions where it is the only word for the job, and makes the victim feel like the lowest of the low.</p>
<br>
<p>scum == </p>
<p>Anyone who contributes nothing to our society, save for crime, disease and misery.</p>
<br>
<p>scum == </p>
<p>Anybody hailing from Hull.</p>
<br>
<p>scum == </p>
<p>Undesirable football fan following crap teams that play in yellow tops in Hertfordshire, UK.</p>
<br>
<p>scum == </p>
<p>1. n. Limescale buildup, or other unsavoury impurities</p>
<p>2. n. Supporters or playing staff of an opposition football team, generally of a local rival</p>
<br>
<p>scum == </p>
<p>A sub-species which is becoming all too common in the UK thanks to the dumbing down of the education system and the fact that the police spend their time either
 filling in paperwork or going after motorists.  Examples of scum can be found everywhere, from the highest to the lowest parts of society.  Politicians, big businessmen and the like are more corrupt and self-serving than ever.  In the town
 where I live, psychiatrists have walked away from causing serious head injuries
 and from telling their patients they're possessed by ghosts.  Meanwhile, it is 
dangerous to go out onto the streets after dark in many towns or cities.  This is mainly due to brain-dead head-bangers who patrol the streets looking for prey,
 doing in gangs or or in pairs what they wouldn't have the guts to do on their own.  Most people grow out of schoolboy-type behaviour, but there is a certain breed who seem unable to do so.  They remain as yobs well into late middle-age and
 beyond.  Indeed, I was minding my own business when someone started hooting the
ir car-horn at me.  When I gave them the finger, they stopped their car (at a crossroad, causing a hold-up).  I was then threatened by some fat old git in dungarees.  When I failed to be scared by his threat, he threatened me again but this
 time added an 'f-word', as though that made him sound scarier or more grown-up.
  I still failed to be scared, and he gave up and went on his way.  People like 
this deserve only pity.  And that's another thing.  Scum of all ages seem to think swearing is both grown-up and the height of comedy.  Their world-beaters are 
all over public toilet walls, galvanised-metal lamp posts and the like.  They also shout things from cars as they drive by, big brave men that they are.  Their 
girlfriends are usually brainless bimbos who think crime is glamorous and are turned on by thuggish behaviour.  </p>
<br>
<p>scum == </p>
<p>Despicable piece of shit who would steal anything or hurt anyone because the're just too low to carve out a decent way to do anything. Their futures in life usually contain the words 'Mcdonalds drive-thru' and 'Correctional Facility'. See townie.</p>

<div class=wanker>
<h1>wanker</h1>
<br>
<p>wanker == </p>
<p>While "to wank" means "to masturbate", the term "wanker" is seldom if ever used in British slang to denote "one who wanks".  It is quite wrong to infer from somebody's being a wanker that they in fact wank (and vice versa), but of course, fair to assume they do in any case.  Herein lies the genius of the insult: if you call someone a wanker, it's probably true, but only literally.</p>
 <p>I suppose it all originates from our repressed Victorian sexualities, from back when everybody thought they were the only ones to suffer the secret shame of being an actual wanker.</p>
 <p>Most children these days learn the word "wanker" long before they learn its literal meaning.</p>

<br>
<p>wanker == </p>
<p>A complete tosser.  Someone who makes
as little effort as they can possibly
get away with.</p>
<p> In British English that's what "wanker"
means - it does not literely mean 
a masterbater (though doubt he is one).
 Just as "he's a bugger" does not 
literally mean he commits sodomy...</p>
<br>
<p>wanker == </p>
<p>A commonly used Australian/british/new zealand word used to describe a fuckball, jerk, asshole or jackass.</p>
<p>Another word for tosser, which is usually reffered to when someone is being a tool or a complete dick. The term is usually asscossiated with one who masturbates regularly. Often reffered to as having a wank, hence the term wanker (one who wanks).</p>
<br>
<p>wanker == </p>

 <p>My Opinion:</p>
 <p>Don't say that something is gay as an insult. I find this highly immature, mostly because it is often used when people can't think of a proper insult even when there is nothing homosexual about whatever they're insulting.</p>

<h1>lesbian</h1>
<br>
<p>lesbian == </p>
<p>a woman whose emotional, romantic, and sexual energies are geared towards other women.</p>
<br>
<p>lesbian == </p>
<p>A female, like myself, who finds other females attractive and sexually stimulating. It doesnt alwayz have to be about the sex though. Being a lesbian, one can find love in another females eyes and not think nothing of it. I'm engaged to a female which makes me a lesbian, but I hate when people stereotype us. Both of us are females...that means neither of us try to act or look like fuckin men.  what would be the point in lookin and acting like a guy if we are lesbians??</p>
<br>
<p>lesbian == </p>
<p>A woman who loves or is sexually attracted to women. I read through other descriptions of lesbian and some people who made definitions on this word are just plain retarded.</p>
 <p>1. There is NO good or bad type of lesbian. It doesnt matter if they are ugly or pretty. They are people. Just like you get ugly and pretty straight people. You don't group them into 'good and bad groups' do you? =/. </p>
 <p>2. Lesbians aren't all man haters. Yes a few are. But then again some (i'm not saying all) straight men are sexist towards women and treat them as objects. So you can't say that lesbians are all sexist when plenty of straight people are.</p>
 <p>3. Those skanks you see on internet porn are not lesbians. They are whores that are trying to get guys to fuck them. If they are real lesbians then they AREN'T going to let you fuck them. Look up 'bi-sexual' asshole. </p>
 <p>4. YOU AREN'T GOING TO TURN A LESBIAN STRAIGHT BY HAVING SEX WITH THEM. OMG. That's just plain stupid. Some guys that have their heads up their asses seem to think that lesbians are women you havn't ever had sex with a man before. Or that being homosexual is just a mental illness or something that can only be cured with sex with a guy. =/. If she's a lesbian then she's not going to appreciate you trying to fuck her. You'll probably just get slapped. </p>
<br>
<p>lesbian == </p>
<p>Women who love other women, in the romantic sense, along with friendship. Heterosexual men often are very aroused by seeing two women making love. Unfortuanately for those men, lesbians are women who are devoted romantically, emotionally, and sexually to other women, not to men.</p>
<br>
<p>lesbian == </p>
<p>Females that are sexually and emotionally attracted to females and only females.</p>
 <p>Lesbian (and being one) does not necessarily mean:</p>
<p>1) Rug muncher/carpet licker etc.</p>
<p>2) Being ugly.</p>
<p>3) Being desperate and not being able to get men.</p>
<p>4) A fifteen year old who thinks another girl is pretty.</p>
<p>5) Something that will make you popular if you claim to be it, you are who you are....</p>
<p>6) People with manly features.</p>
<p>7) A loser.</p>
<p>8) Someone to be descriminated.</p>
<p>9) Someone who is any different to hetrosexual person.</p>
<p>10) Someone who got drunk and kissed someone of the same sex.</p>
<br>
<p>lesbian == </p>
<p>A female who is attracted to other females emotionally and sexually. Period. You are not necessarily a lesbian if you have strong feelings of love for other women...do NOT get this confused. Also, if you're with a lesbian, you aren't necessarily a lesbian unless you too love (emotionally and sexually) other women. Lesbians are NOT necessarily man-hating, not ALWAYS feminists, and do NOT always have penis fear or envy. Stereotypes may describe lesbians as slutty girls who sleep with other women to get men in bed, but let's get the facts straight: lesbians = women who love women and want to be with them sexually ONLY. If you're a horny guy looking to get a woman-loving girl in bed, try the word bisexual or man-pleasing whore. :)</p>
<br>
<p>lesbian == </p>
<p>Mystical Creatures. They ride in on unicorns usualy in groups of two. They are very rare. Most people say lesbians are not hot but the lesbians they speak of are of a different evil breed. They Ride in on flying monkeys(or motorcycles as modern people call them) to capture the Pure Hot lesbians to convert them to the ugly ones.  </p>

 <p>2. a girl who likes sex, so she does it. She probably is not in a relationship, and she equalizes herself to guys by treating sex the same way they do.
 The difference between the two examples of what society labels as "sluts" is that one has self respect, the other does not. No one should be called a slut anyway, especially when the name "slut" is a purely judgemental and stereotypical one, and no one really knows the real story behind it all, which is pretty much always the case.</p>
<br>
<p>slut == </p>
<p>A woman who sleeps with many men.</p>

<h1>blowjob</h1>
<br>
<p>blowjob == </p>
<p>When us young ladies put our mouth's on a guys cock and suck repeatedly until they reach orgasm. Giving a blowjob should not be looked upon as a chore, but as a pleasurable thing for both involved. Be sure to pay attention to the whole penis, not just the head. Swirl your tongue around the tip while pumping him with your fist or both, if you like. Lovingly message his balls and always deepthroat it. Alternate your speed when sucking a cock, showing your guy that him coming in your mouth is your top priority. And when he does start to come don't stop what you're doing, suck until he's done. And always swallow with a smile.</p>
<br>
<p>blowjob == </p>
<p>To lick, blow, and suck on a mans dick.  Proper technique including rubbing his balls with left hand, stroking dick with right hand in sync to the pace you are moving your mouth.  To go all the way and deep throat is much desired, while doing this begin to hum and moan.  This will send him up the wall.  When he does reach orgasm and begin to cum swallow it, and lick it off of him.  This will also drive him insane.  
 Like right now, i bet at least 5 guys reading this right now are jacking off fanticizing about someone doing this to them.  Sorry guys, if I was there, u know I would. ;-)</p>

<br>
<p>blowjob == </p>
<p>When I start to kiss down my boyfriends chest and stomach while pulling at his belt loops and pockets slowly getting down to his pants button which i unbutton with my teeth. Then i pull his pants down to about his knees and look up at him and smile. Then i slowly massage his balls with one hand and move my hand up and down his shaft while i slowly suck the head of his penis ever so lightly and swirl my tongue around the tip. i suck him a little bit harder and swirl my tongue faster. i suck harder as his dick slides farther down my throat and suck harder and harder and use my hand to jack him off at the base of his penis. He gets harder and harder and his penis throbs as he is ready to cum. I moan and suck harder and squeeze the base of his penis while i suck. He cums and the cum goes all the way down my throat, i look up at him and smile as a swallow it all.
 THAT is a blow job.</p>
<br>
<p>blowjob == </p>
<p>One of the best parts of sex ever. This is when a woman performs oral sex to a man by putting her lips on his dick and sucks it hard and deep. This is for the mans to enjoyment and for the woman to give out of generously, curiously, or just plain loving to give blowjobs. Then after she performs this she can either swallow the cum or spit it out. I think swallowing is one of the sexiest things a woman can do so ladies SWALLOW ON and SUCK HARD.</p>

<p>vagina == </p>
<p>My god damn favorite part of my body.
Whenever I get turned on a lot, it starts throbbing, possibly getting wet.
What feels best is to move your fingers quickly just inside of it, teasing her, then quickly shove your fingers in and move your fingers in a "petting" motion, making sure not to just sit there stabbing it, that doesn't feel to hot.
It also gets cranky once a month, which can be a bitch.</p>
<br>
<p>vagina == </p>
<p>The vagina is a buggy, often catastrophically so, feature of the Female Edition of the Human Being version 1.0. After approximately 13 to 16 years of proper operation, the vagina becomes problematic and starts failing periodically (no pun intended) around once a month. This in turn leads to the corruption (often permanent) of the mental faculties of the host. Whenever this happens, the individual in question is commonly referred to as "a bitch."
 It is widely expected by pundits and pollsters alike that the vagina will be either entirely removed or fixed by the next release of Homo Sapiens Sapiens. When asked about any current patches to resolve this issue in existing organisms, Evolution clearly stated that it has "no resources available at the moment." In addition, it was widely made known by Nature that the vagina was a design decision "not fully thought-out." As a result, humanity has suffered the devastating consequences, on a roughly monthly basis.</p>

When the human female is sexually aroused the clitoris fills with blood and the many condensed nerve endings become even more sensitive, whereby enough stimulation of the clitoris can result in a female orgasm, which releases the pressure by means of .08 second apart contractions throughout the vulva.</p>

<p>The way the British royal family keeps itself German.</p>
<br>
<p>incest == </p>
<p>When somebody has sex with a member of their own family. When in doujinshi or fanfics, when two characters who belong to the same family, do such a forbidden action seen as wrong by many, but consensually because they are in love with each 
other, it automatically hyperboosts the quality of the doujinshi/fic. In real life, there is a level of controversy regarding incest. People in America can't do
 it, even in a consensual manner, by law, the British Royal Family has to do it 
by law, and some places probably don't even give a fuck whether you do it or not
, as long as both partners wanted to do it, therefore no one being raped. When a
 lot of people think incest, they think deformed children and rape. But, birth control + consent of both partners = the right to declare a stereotype that anti-
incest laws revolve around, false. Incest = redneck? Not necessarily. Anyone from any walk of life could be practicing incest. If somebody falls in love with a 
family member, you know sex will most likely be involved, therefore stereotype #2 has been declared false.</p>

<p>Semen is a part of a government plot to get rid of America's excess toothpaste and pine fresh by mixing them together, calling the mixture "semen", and spreading it over most of our consumer's food, primarily in school cafeterias. The result is a tasty lard/egg-white substitute, however, too much semen consumption (usually in males) may lead to a build-up in the excretory system (our kidneys, bladder, etc...) and may be ejaculated upon stimulation with pumping, pulling, rubbing, and other painful procedures. 
 The ejaculation of this "semen" is mandatory to remain healthy or side effects may occur, including but not limited to: loneliness, nerdiness, explosion in the urethrea, and/or constipation.
 Why some females choose to consume the fluid is probably to clean their teeth (toothpaste) or freshen their breath (pine fresh)</p>
