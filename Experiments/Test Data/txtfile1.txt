The main reason I don't want children is because I don't want to go through pregnancy. Morning sickness, loss of bladder control, you have to pee constantly, weird cravings, your mental ability decreases, you gain weight, your figure goes to shit....If someone showed up at my door with a newborn and handed it to me, I would raise that fucker like a champ. But if one month my period is late, and it turns out I'm pregnant, I would freak the fuck out.
I cant imagine how women can deal with the pain when they pull this shit out of their juju , oh god . :O
They are high as fuck when they give birth. Helps a lot.
And they still won't let us fuck them in the ass because it hurts. Bullshit.
Scumbag baby
Where the fuck goes the all the intestines?
Female human got infected via sex and the parasite grow in their body until they hatch out.
Nice...boobs gets bigger
Boobs will definitely grow more than that
Fuck humanity, I would never wish that pain on anybody. Don't worry, future imaginary wifey, we can adopt
