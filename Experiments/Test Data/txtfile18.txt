To everyone trying to explain this: It still looks bloody stupid. Sword fights are supposed to be exciting, not make people laugh (unless it's a comedy). If any of you are directing something like this, just read up a little on sword choreography.
Still beter than the shit saber fights in The Force Awakens
Maybe useless but fucking cool to watch
Oh, would you stop whining you fuckin' babies?
I'm sick of people trying to justify this nonsense. It's been ten years and it just looks fucking dumb. Get over yourselves.
I was just waiting for it to fuck up.
Fuck you and your gay snake.
This Gif is actually annoying as fuck.
I have ocdc it's like ocd but it fucking rocks.
I looked to the GIF hoping that at some point this will get fucked up.
